## Use

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwaitzel/SuggestedColors/master/CreateFile.png)

Go to Edit->Create SuggestedColors file and a plist will be created. Add colors there with NAME and HEX VALUE

Change useMyColors entry to activate/deactivate it

## Important - Do not change plist file name
For now :P

## Installation
Either

- Install it via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/)

or

- Clone and build the plugin yourself, it will be installed to the right location automatically by building it.


In any case, relaunch Xcode to load it.

## Known Issues
1- I change useMyColors to NO/YES but the Interface Builder doesn't update
  FIX: Alt-tab to another window and it should refresh
